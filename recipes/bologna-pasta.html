    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> I am not reinventing the wheel here. I am just giving you my recipe for a simple, lower calorie version of one of my favourite dishes, the notorious spaghetti bolognese.
        </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100gr to 150gr* Spaghetti (The lower calorie version you can find)</li>
            <li>100gr to 150gr** Lean ground beef (5% prefered)</li>
            <li>100gr Tomato sauce (again pick a lower calorie version)</li>
        </ul>
    <div><em>*The amount of spaguetti depends on your personal taste and the amount of calories and carbs you need.</em></div>
    <div><em>**The amount of ground beef depends on the amount of protein you need.</em></div>
       
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti in boiling water for the duration indicated.</li>
            <li>Cook the meat in a non sticky pan, without adding anything. If your pan stick, put a very small amount of the oil of your choice on a paper towel and spread it on the pan.</li>
            <li>Once the pastas and the meat are cooked, put them together in a pot and add the tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Mix it, add some salt and pepper, and <em>voila!</em></li>
        </ol>
