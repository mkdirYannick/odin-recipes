    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For me, this recipe is a life saver. I love Ice cream but it is very calorie-dense and sugary. This version is high in protein, and very low in calories for the amount of food you get to eat.
        </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100gr Banana</li>
            <li>200gr Ice cubes</li>
            <li>100ml Hazelnut milk</li>
            <li>40gr Chocolate protein powder</li>
            <li>20gr Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Xantham gum</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put all the ingredients in a blender, <strong><u>except the xantham gum.</u></strong></li>
            <li>Mix until the ice cubes are broken down and the preparation is somewhat homogeneous.</li>
            <li>Add the xantham gum and mix until the preparation is thick and more voluminous.*</li>
            <li>Eat right after when it is still cool, enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p><em>*Be carefull, your blender might struggle and overheat. If that's the case, takes some breaks during this steps.</em></p>
