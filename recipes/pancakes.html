    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of my goal in life, among other things (like learning to code), is to be fit.
            But one of my biggest weakness is food. I love to eat, probably a bit too much for my own good.
            So, how do I combined the two? By eating delicious meals that are lower in calorie and made with healthy ingredient.
            This is the recipe for one of those meals.
        </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>50gr oats</li>
        <li>1 banana (~130g)</li>
        <li>35gr vanilla protein powder</li>
        <li>50ml hazelnut milk (or any plant milk you like)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch of cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put all the ingredients in a blender, and blend until you have an homogenous texture</li>
            <li>Pour the desired amount of dough on a pan set to low-medium eat</li>
